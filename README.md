# Numerical-Analysis
Four different projects done in class that utilize numerical methods to give insight to physical systems. Each project uses jupyter notebook and Ipython to perform the computations. I completed each project with one partner. The description for each project is given in the project itself. Each project is saved in Ipython notebook format and pdf format.
